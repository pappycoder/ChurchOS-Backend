/**

 *
 * Engagement Score (0-100): Measures how actively a member participates.
 * Factors: attendance frequency, giving activity, event participation,
 * communication engagement (WhatsApp messages).
 *
 * Risk Score (0-100): Measures likelihood of member disengagement.
 * Factors: declining attendance, no giving activity, no communication,
 * inactive status, age of last activity.
 *
 * Both scores are recalculated nightly via the BullMQ nightly-jobs queue.
 * Results are stored in the engagement_scores and risk_scores tables.

 * @module pastoral/scoring.service
