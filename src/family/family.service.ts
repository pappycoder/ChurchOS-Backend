/**

 * Handles CRUD operations for families and their member associations.
 * A Family groups related church members (e.g., a household). Each family
 * has a head member and can contain multiple FamilyMember links with
 * relationship types (spouse, child, parent, etc.).
 *
 * All queries are scoped by church_id for multi-tenant data isolation.
 * All mutations are audit-logged.
